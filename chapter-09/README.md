# Chapter 9 Exercises


1. Write a function `void add42(int *dst)` which adds 42 to the value pointed at by its argument.
2. Write a function `int product(int x, int y, int z)` in assembly that muliplies its arguments together and returns the result. The third parameter to a func on is stored in `edx`.
3. Write a function `int quintuple(int x)` in assembly that returns the value of its argument times five.
