# Chapter 11 Exercises


1. Write a function `unsigned int factorial(unsigned int)` that multiplies all numbers from 1 to top and re- turns their product.
2. The Collatz sequence is generated by staring with any positive integer and repeatedly applying the following func ons un l the value 1 is reached:

```text
Collatz (N ev en ) = N/2
Collatz (N odd ) = 3N + 1
```

Although no excepions have been found, there is no formal mathemaical proof as to whether or not this sequence always ends in 1. Write a func on that counts and returns the number of steps to 1 from a given staring number, `int collatz_steps(int N)`

3. Write a function `int sum(short *arr, size_t sz)` that returns the sum of all numbers in the array `arr`.

### Hints:

You can do a printf like this if you need help debugging:

```assembly
	push	rax			# Preserve rax
	push	rcx			# Preserve rcx
	push	r8			# Preserve r8
	push	r9			# Preserve r9
	push	rdi			# Needed for 16-byte alignment
	mov	rsi,rax			# rsi has value to print
	xor	rax,rax			# rax has number of XMMx in use
	lea	rdi, [rip + evenm]	# rdi has message to format
	call	printf@plt		# call printf
	pop	rdi
	pop	r9
	pop	r8
	pop	rcx
	pop	rax
```
